Code to control a Sony Camera through WiFi using the Sony Camera Remote API and an ESP8266 microcontroller. After start up the ESP8266 creates a AP and a webserver to show a configuration page. The webpage allows to enter the camera's network name and password; the timelapse duration and number of pictures also can be configured here. After saving the settings, the ESP8266 connects to the camera, and wait for the signal to start the timelapse.
